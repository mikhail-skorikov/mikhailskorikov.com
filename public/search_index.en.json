The one I am going to talk about is Migadu.\nThis hidden gem of a provider has free trials and for a small price of $19 per year, with reasonable limits, you get unlimited (practically) domains and mailboxes for them, with 5 GB storage which is enough for a moderate number of domains and mailboxes. The other pricing plans are even more liberal in how much you can do with it but for a basic setup, $19 per year is pocket change compared to most popular options.\nTo set up your own email addresses for your domain, you need to sign up for Migadu and have access to manage your domain’s DNS records.\nStep 1: Create domain in Migadu\nOnce you have signed up for Migadu, log in to your account and under Email Domains, go to New Domain\n\nAdd in your domain name, selecting external nameservers as the default.\nAccept the default addresses (admin, postmaster, abuse) creation as they are part of the email standards, although they’re not required.\nStep 2: Add DNS records to your domain\nThe setup instructions are provided by Migadu when you add your domain to Migadu with values automatically set for you to copy-paste. Go to your domain registrar, and open up its DNS management page.\nTo give an example of how easy it is to configure your DNS records based on Migadu instructions is:\n\n\nFirst is a verification TXT record for uniquely identifying your domain:\n\n\n\nThen add MX records to route addresses to Migadu host:\n\n\n\nAdd DKIM + ARC key records for authenticating the email’s integrity:\n\n\n\nAdd SPF Record of type TXT and DMARC record which is designed to prevent email forging in combination with DMARC:\n\n\n\nThere are some optional features for some clients and service discovery which you can set up similarly following the Migadu instructions if you need those.\nStep 3: Verify!\nOnce the records are added, click on the Check Configuration button near the top of the instructions page in Migadu, which will probably send you to the login page due to session timeout. That is okay. After logging in again, you’ll either be told it’s already up, because Migadu checks the domain records after accessing domain setup page again, or you’ll see that some of the records are updated while others are not. That is also fine, if you have added the records correctly. DNS record propagation takes time, so check back in a few minutes, or hours if it is taking longer - it varies how long it takes but can take up to a day or more.\nStep 4: Add email addresses\nOnce your domain is configured though, you can go to Mailboxes &gt; New Mailbox and create an email address as you want to call it, and as you want to authenticate it. Set an initial password, or send password setting link to an email, it’s up to you!\nThat’s it!\nAnd that’s it. You can log into the email address from Migadu Webmail. That part is not explicitly stated if you set your initial password, but email invitations have instructions to do so.\nYou can also use your own email clients to set up email receiving and sending as an alternative to Migadu Webmail. Migadu has guides on how to set those up here.\n","path":null}]
